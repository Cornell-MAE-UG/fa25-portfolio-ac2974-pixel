As part of a class project I used Force and joint pin analysis to design a mechanism to lift a heavy object a certain height using a linear actuator. Calculations were made to accurately analyze and maximize the height and the weight of the object.

This is how I solved the problem:
![helo]({{ "/assets/images/Page7.jpg" | relative_url }}){: .inline-image-l}

![hello sadasdasd]({{ "/assets/images/Page8.jpg" | relative_url }}){: .inline-image-l}

By comparing the ratings of the different linear actuators, I found that using a IMA33(1 Stack) gives the greatest height, and the IMA55 gives the largest weight. Depending on my priorities, either one of these actuators would work great for the job.
